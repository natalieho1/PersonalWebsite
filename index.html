            Hi, I'm Natalie! 
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently a senior at Wellesley and a mathematician who loves 
            learning about how great companies are built. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a research analyst at <a href="https://chapterone.com/">Chapter One</a> working on due diligence and thesis work, 
            and learning <a href="https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/"> AI Safety Fundamentals.</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Previously I was at <a href="https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/accelerator/program/"> MIT’s startup accelerator</a>, where I worked alongside founders and learned how to build businesses from the ground up.
            <br>
            <br>
            I spent my junior year abroad at the University of Oxford, learning statistics, group theory, and real analysis. During my spring break, I went on the Camino de Santiago, a two week pilgrimage backpacking from Portugal to Spain.

            <br>
            I started blogging while I was on the Camino; It is the best way to understand how I think and the experiences that have shaped me: <br><br>

            In my free time, I enjoy running, rowing, and making music. Sophomore year I wrote and produced a pop song called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/02Dr6jdtWaqBwPrLTj8RIj?si=d5586773975944cf">“Caught Dancing”</a>.
